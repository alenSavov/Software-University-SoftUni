    Eventures
</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Eventures</strong>
    <strong>Inc</strong>
. is a fast-rising newly made Start-Up Company, which specializes in    <strong>Event Tickets Sales</strong>. It is said to be the killer of
    systems like Eventim, Eventbride, etc.
</p>
<p>
You have been appointed as the developer of the    <strong>main web application</strong>. This is a great responsibility, so
    do your best and do not dissapoint your employers. The application
functionality is not that complex, and it will be    <strong>separated</strong> into <strong>several parts</strong>, each part
    consisting of <strong>several tasks</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Your current task is to extend the <strong>business logic</strong> of the    <strong>application</strong>, by testing the logic you’ve implemented by
    now.
</p>
<h2>
    1. Architectural Changes
</h2>
<p>
    If you’ve not done it so far… Extract the business logic to Services so
    that you separate the Application Layer from the Data Layer. Extract any
    functionality which is not correctly placed in the Controller to a separate
    Service.
</p>
<h2>
    2. Unit Testing
</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have what to test, test every method and functionality you
    have in your Services. Write separated Unit Test classes and methods for
    each functionality.
</p>
<h2>
    3. * Integration Testing
</h2>
<p>
    Test your skills and knowledge gained with the Testing Lesson, by
    implementing Integration tests in the Eventures application. Make a
    research on what is good to be tested and verified on an Integration level
    and test the most basic stuff.
</p>
<h2>
    4. ** Selenium Testing
</h2>
<p>
    Automate your browser and verify the content that the Eventures App
    provides to its Clients.
