    The “Programming Fundamentals” course extends the previously gained basic
    coding skills from the “
    <a href="https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-basics">
        Programming Basics
    </a>
    ” course at the Software University and adds additional knowledge and
    practical programming skills.
</p>
<p>
    The course covers understanding the basic data types in programming,
    extracting pieces of code into methods with parameters and return value,
    using the debugger to trace the program execution and find bugs, processing
    sequences of elements using arrays and lists, using collections, working
    with matrices for processing tabular data, working with dictionaries to map
    keys to values, using strings for text processing, and the basics of
    working with classes and objects, using API classes and defining simple
    classes.
</p>
<p>
    Along with the programming techniques, the algorithmic thinking and problem
    solving skills are advanced by solving hundreds of practical programming
    problems. All exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with
real-time feedback through the    <a href="https://judge.softuni.bg/">SoftUni online judge system</a>. At the
    end all students take a practical programming exam.
